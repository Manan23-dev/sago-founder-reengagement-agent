Subject: Re: Northwind AI - quick follow-up

Hi Avery,

Wanted to circle back after our last chat.
At our October meeting you mentioned you were piloting with 2 design partners and targeting an enterprise rollout in Q1.

A few updates caught my eye:
- Northwind AI announced GA of their workflow agent
- Northwind AI posted 3 enterprise AE roles
- Rumor: Northwind AI raising a seed extension
- Tech outlet mentions Northwind AI customer wins

If you're open to it, I'd like to reconnect and understand where things stand now.
Are you free for 20 minutes next week?

Best,
Jordan
